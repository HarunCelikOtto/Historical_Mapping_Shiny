# Segmented Raster

## Libraries

```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(aRcGeo)
library(arcgisbinding)
library(reticulate)
```

# ArcGIS Initialization

Just as we did for the stretch function, we will need to first initialize the connection to ArcGIS to run our segmentation.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
aRcGeo::init_arcpy(conda_env = "arcgispro-py3-DeepLearning")
```

# Segment Processing

```{r, eval=FALSE}
Buchanan_Segmented <- arcpy$sa$SegmentMeanShift(in_raster = "img/png_prj/Buchanan_Stretch.png",
                                                spectral_detail = 5,
                                                spatial_detail = 15)
```

After running the function, we yield the following results.
